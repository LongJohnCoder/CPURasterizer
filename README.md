# CPURasterizer

Efficient CPU based rasterizer

CPU implementation of a very efficient rasterizer which utilizes `AVX2` instructions and lock-free multi-threading programming. Using tiled rendering the program consumes 8 pixels at the same time, which together with `std::execution` threading library makes it very fast and robust. The viewer of the project is a very simple OpenGL applicatoin which renders a texture to a quad. The texture is generated by the CPU `Renderer.h` class. The pipeline contains most of the modern GPU rasterizers stages including:

- Vertex Transformation
- Clipping
- Rasterization
- Perspective Corrected Interpolation
- Fragment Shading
- Depth Testing

Except rasterization pipeine the project contains serveral additional features:   

- Tiled rendering using AVX2 (2x4 pixels tile)
- Shadow maps
- MSAA
- Texture sampling
- OpenGL viewer (only texture rendering)
- C++17

### Performance

All tests were done on CPU i4790k with 4 cores

| Scene         | Triangles | MSAA | FPS |
| ------------- |-----------|------|-----|
| Cornell box   | 36        |  1x  | 60  |
| Coffee cart   | 27000     |  1x  | 60  |
| Panther       | 2000000   |  1x  |  8  |

### How to run

All dependencies needed for the project can be downloaded using `install.bat` script. The project has `Visual Studio 2019` solution.
